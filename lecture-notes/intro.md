# Statistics: A Science Fiction Adventure

The core task of science is to derive knowledge of our world from data. 
We build theoretical models for planets formation, exoplanet atmospheres, 
the dynamics of the Milky Way, accretion onto black holes, the evolution of 
galaxies, and many more. But building a theory, a hypothesis or a numerical 
model is only the first step: we have to know whether it is not just physically
consistent, but also plausible given the world we live in. When models predict 
observations, we can then design experiments (in the lab, or in the form of 
measurements taken with a telescope) to try and see how well these observations 
match the predictions made by our theory. 

The methods and tools we use to make these comparisons are developed in the 
field of _applied statistics_. To a student or researcher in the physical 
sciences, statistics can often appear to be opaque and complicated, a set of 
fixed recipes rather than a scientific field of study as dynamic as the field 
of astrophysics. Indeed, statistical methods _are_ often taught as recipes to 
be applied to lab experiments and astrophysical measurements, without much 
thought given to the underlying foundations and assumptions used in creating 
these recipes. Because of its opaqueness, statistics is often seen by students 
as particularly difficult or scary, and as uninteresting, the recipes learned 
without alternative. 

In this course, we aim to do a number of things: first and foremost, we want 
to use storytelling to help learners gain an intuition of statistical concepts 
with the help of every-day (or at least every-day in a science fiction setting) 
situations. Even though statistical concepts can sometimes counter our every-day 
intuition, we generally find that even beyond our scientific work, we use 
statistical reasoning in our lives every day. We hope that embedding statistics 
learning in the context of a larger story will make it more accessible to a wide 
range of audiences, from high school through to PhD studies, and lower the barrier 
towards finding an interest in these tools and methods.  

Secondly, we want to teach statistics not as a set of recipes, but to explain 
where certain concepts come from, how to apply them to certain types of data, 
and how to change and extend them to new types of data. We will pay particular 
attention to the underlying assumptions made in the construction of certain method. 

Above all, we would like to use this course to foster curiosity for data, and for 
how we learn about the world using that data. As we have mentioned above, statistics 
is not a static field, and especially the advent of _data science_ and _machine learning_  
have led to a range of exciting new approaches and developments that are useful for 
us in the physical sciences. 

We hope you will enjoy this course.
